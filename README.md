I thought it might be nice to document my thought process and feelings around Genuary this year. This project has always felt like more than art to me. I wrote this last year...

> For the last five years I have participated in Genuary. Every year, generative artists come together and make art that follows a set of 31 prompts, one for each day in January. 
> 
> **2021**: I had just started making generative art and there was still so much for me to explore. I put in the time and energy to learning something new each day. I did not have a lot of rules, I just wanted to make.
> 
> **2022**: I was a little lost. I didn't complete every prompt, I didn't have the same energy or excitement around creation.
> 
> **2023**: I was intentional. I set rules: same color palette, complete the prompts in order, complete them all in January. I needed that structure and it was lovely.
> 
> **2024**: I was rusty. I don't make generative art in the same way I used to. I am out of practice, but the only way to fix that is to practice. I have completed 30/31 prompts. I am not good at ending things.
> 
> **2025**: Learning and making art is keeping me sane in a precarious world. I am using new skills like git to share the code for my work. I am pen plotting some of my designs. I am posting my work in discord servers full of other artists. I am not thinking too hard, just letting the art flow out of me. It is exciting.

This year I will have a lot less time and energy to dedicate to this project. This is a good thing. I have a job with a lot of responsibility. This is a bad thing. I haven't coded in six months. I actually need to do this, whether it is going to feel easy or not. I need to do this to carve out some of what I love.
